# How to Contribute

This is a technical guide that helps Kotlin and Java developers understand how SkyHanni works, and provides the first
steps for new Forge developers to take.

## Development Environment Setup

When making changes to the code, it is recommended to use an IDE for live debugging and testing.
This tutorial explains how to set up the development environment for SkyHanni.
We use [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) as an example.

### Download IntelliJ

- Download IntelliJ from the [JetBrains Website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
    - Use the Community Edition. (Scroll down a bit.)
- When you encounter any bug with IntelliJ, please make sure to use the version `2024.1.6`, not `2024.2.x` or above.

### Cloning the project

- Create an account on GitHub
    - Go to https://github.com/hannibal002/SkyHanni
    - Click on the fork button to create a fork.
        - Leave the settings unchanged
        - Click on `create fork`
    - Open IntelliJ
        - Link the GitHub account with IntelliJ.
        - Install Git in IntelliJ.
        - In IntelliJ, go to `new` ‚Üí `project from version control`.
        - Select `SkyHanni` from the list.
        - Open the project.

### Setting up IntelliJ


Once your project is imported into IntelliJ from the previous step, all dependencies like Minecraft, NEU, and so on should be automatically
downloaded. If not, you might need to link the Gradle project in the Gradle tab (little elephant) on the right.

<details>
<summary>üñºÔ∏èShow Gradle tab image</summary>

![Gradle tab with Link Project and Gradle Settings highlighted](docs/gradle-tab.jpg)

</details>

If importing fails, make sure the Gradle JVM (found in the settings wheel in the Gradle tab, or by searching <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + A</kbd>
for "Gradle JVM") is set to a Java 21 JDK. While this is not the version of Java Minecraft 1.8.9 uses, we need this version for some of our
build tools.

<details>
<summary>üñºÔ∏èShow Gradle JVM image</summary>

![Gradle settings showing Java 21 being selected as JVM](docs/gradle-settings.png)

</details>

After all importing is done (which might take a few minutes the first time you download the project), you should find a new IntelliJ run
configuration.

<details>
<summary>üñºÔ∏èShow run configuration selection image</summary>

![Where to select the run configuration](docs/minecraft-client.webp)

</details>

That task might work out of the box, but very likely it will not. We will need to adjust the used Java version. Since Minecraft 1.8.9 uses
Java 1.8, we will need to adjust the used JDK for running our Mod, as well as potentially changing the argument passing style.

So select an appropriate Java 1.8 JDK (preferably [DCEVM](#hot-swap), but any Java 1.8 JDK or even JRE will do) and select None as the
argument passing style.

<details>
<summary>üñºÔ∏èShow run configuration image</summary>

![Run configuration settings](docs/run-configuration-settings.avif)

</details>

Now that we are done with that, you should be able to launch your game from your IDE with that run configuration.

SkyHanni's Gradle configuration is very similar to the one used in **NotEnoughUpdates**, so if you want to look at another guide, check
out [their guide](https://github.com/NotEnoughUpdates/NotEnoughUpdates/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Pull Requests

General infos about Pull Request can be found on the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests).

### Creating a Pull Request

If you are not very familiar with git, you might want to try this out: https://learngitbranching.js.org/.

Proposed changes are best made in their own branch, as this makes development easier for both you and the maintainers of this repository.
You can do this by following the instructions within the IntelliJ window in the open SkyHanni project:

- Click the beta dropdown at the top of IntelliJ.
- Click **New branch**.
- Give the branch a name related to the changes you plan to make.

_A more in-depth explanation of how to use IntelliJ and branches will follow someday._

### Guidelines for Pull Requests

Please use a prefix for the PR name (e.g., Feature, Improvement, Fix, Backend, etc.).

When writing the PR description, ensure you fill out the template with all the necessary information.
In the **What** section, write technical details or explanations that don't belong in the changelog.
Including that field is optional for small changes.

If your PR relies on another PR, please include this information at the beginning of the description. Use the format `- #<pr number>`
for the dependency, or `- <url>` for REPO dependencies.

### Changelog Builder

The PR description is processed by our [ChangeLog Builder](https://github.com/SkyHanniStudios/SkyHanniChangelogBuilder).

- Follow the format examples from the template and remove the categories that do not apply to your PR.
- A PR might include multiple changelog categories simultaneously.

Here is an explanation of which changes belong to each category:

#### New Features

New standalone features that are independent of existing features. Additional settings for existing features belong in the **Improvements**
category.

#### Improvements

Changes that improve or expand the code's logic and have a visible impact on users. This category is for enhancements, not for fixing
incorrect logic.
The line between bug fixes and improvements is sometimes not clear. If you are unsure whether a change is an improvement or a bug fix, ask
for guidance.

#### Fixes

Bug fixes, including typos (only those visible to the user, e.g., in config or chat messages), missing checks that cause incorrect behavior
under specific conditions, or logic errors.
Only significant performance issues are considered bugs; otherwise, they fall under **Technical Details**. If the code does not behave as
intended by the original developer, it is a bug. If the original code had logical errors, it is a bug. If the original code lacks nuance but
is not incorrect, it is not a bug.

#### Technical Details

Internal changes that do not impact the end user. Examples include:

- Refactoring (renaming or moving members, functions, classes, files or packages)
- Typos in object names (which the end user will not see)
- API updates
- Minor performance improvements
- Preparations for modern Minecraft versions
- Documentation changes to markdown files, e.g., in `/docs` or this file.

Try to avoid using this when the main goal of the PR is a user facing change, and the included backend change is related to that change.
We mostly only need standalone changes or big/relevant backend changes marked as Technical Details,
everything else can go in the normal PR description (What area). 

#### Removed Features

Features that have merged with existing features (in the config) or have become obsolete (e.g., if Hypixel implements them on the server
side).

#### No category

Some changes don't fit any categories.
E.g. when reverting pull requests or doing quick fixes to PRs merged immediately beforehand but not yet released in a beta.
To tell the changelog build this, write either `exclude_from_changelog` or `ignore_from_changelog` in one line.
Make sure such pull requests have a good explanation in the **What** section.

## Coding Styles and Conventions

- Follow the [Hypixel Rules](https://hypixel.net/rules).
- Use the coding conventions for [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html)
  and [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-contents.html).
-  **My build is failing due to `detekt`, what do I do?**
    - `detekt` is our code quality tool. It checks for code smells and style issues.
    - If you have a build failure stating `Analysis failed with ... weighted issues.`, you can check `versions/[target version]/build/reports/detekt/` for a comprehensive list of issues.
    - **There are valid reasons to deviate from the norm**
        - If you have such a case, either use `@Supress("rule_name")`, or re-build the `baseline.xml` file, using `./gradlew detektBaselineMain`.
          After running detektBaselineMain, you should find a file called `baseline-main.xml` in the `version/1.8.9` folder, rename the file to
          `baseline.xml` replacing the old one.
- Do not copy features from other mods. Exceptions:
    - Mods that are paid to use.
    - Mods that have reached their end of life. (Rip SBA, Dulkir and Soopy).
        - The mod has, according to Hypixel rules, illegal features ("cheat mod/client").
        - If you can improve the existing feature in a meaningful way.
- All new classes should be written in Kotlin, with a few exceptions:
    - Config files in `at.hannibal2.skyhanni.config.features`
    - Mixin classes in `at.hannibal2.skyhanni.mixins.transformers`
- New features should be made in Kotlin objects unless there is a specific reason for it not to.
    - If the feature needs to register Forge/Fabric events, uses SkyHanni events or creates repo patterns, annotate the feature classs it with `@SkyHanniModule`
    - This will automatically register all events to the respective event bus, and loads the repo patterns.
    - In the background, this will create a new file `LoadedModules.kt` when compiling. Please ignore this file and the related error in `SkyHanniMod.kt`.
- Avoid using deprecated functions.
    - These functions are marked for removal in future versions.
    - If you're unsure why a function is deprecated or how to replace it, please ask for guidance.
- Future JSON data objects should be made in kotlin and placed in the directory `at.hannibal2.skyhanni.data.jsonobjects`
- Config files should be made in **Kotlin**.
    - There may be legacy config files left as Java files, however they will all be ported eventually.
- Please use the existing event system, or expand on it. Do not use Forge events.
    - To expand the event systems you can create a new event that is called from a Mixin
    - Or you can subscribe to a Forge event and then post a SkyHanni event from that. See the `api/minecraftevents` package for examples.
    - If you make a new event there are a few different types of events that you can make, make sure your event extends one of these.
      - SkyHanniEvent: This is just a normal event.
      - CancelableSkyHanniEvent: This is a cancellable event. It has a `cancel()` method that you can call to cancel the event.
      - GenericSkyHanniEvent: This is a generic event, typically used for entities but can be used for any generics.
      - RenderingSkyHanniEvent: This is an event that you are allowed to do GUI rendering in.
- Please use existing utils methods.
- We try to avoid calling the NEU code too often.
    - (We plan to remove NEU as a dependency in the future.)
- We try not to use Forge-specific methods if possible.
    - (We plan to switch to Fabric and Minecraft 1.20 in the future.)
- Never use  `System.currentTimeMillis()`. Use our own class `SimpleTimeMark` instead.
    - See [this commit](https://github.com/hannibal002/SkyHanni/commit/3d748cb79f3a1afa7f1a9b7d0561e5d7bb284a9b)
      as an example.
- Try to avoid using Kotlin's `!!` (catch if not null) feature.
    - Replace it with `?:` (if null return this).
    - This will most likely not be possible to avoid when working with objects from java.
- Don't forget to add `@FeatureToggle` to new standalone features (not options to that feature) in the config.
- Do not use `e.printStackTrace()`, use `ErrorManager.logErrorWithData(error, "explanation for users", ...extraOptionalData)` instead.
- Do not use `MinecraftForge.EVENT_BUS.post(event)`, use `event.post()` instead.
- Do not use `toRegex()` or `toPattern()`, use `RepoPattern` instead.
    - See [RepoPattern.kt](https://github.com/hannibal002/SkyHanni/blob/beta/src/main/java/at/hannibal2/skyhanni/utils/repopatterns/RepoPattern.kt)
    - All repo patterns must be accompanied by a regex test. Look at other patterns for examples, more information and usages.
    - The pattern variables are named in the scheme `variableNamePattern`
- Please use Regex instead of String comparison when it is likely Hypixel will change the message in the future.
- Do not use `fixedRateTimer` when possible and instead use `SecondPassedEvent` to safely execute the repeating event on
  the main thread.
- When updating a config option variable, use the `ConfigUpdaterMigrator.ConfigFixEvent` with event.move() when moving a value, and event.transform() when updating a value. [For Example](https://github.com/hannibal002/SkyHanni/blob/e88f416c48f9659f89b7047d7629cd9a1d1535bc/src/main/java/at/hannibal2/skyhanni/features/gui/customscoreboard/CustomScoreboard.kt#L276).
- Use American English spelling conventions (e.g., "color" not "colour").
- When creating/updating a command, move it out of the `Commands.kt` class, if it isn't already, into the class that it belongs to.
- Avoid direct function imports. Always access functions or members through their respective namespaces or parent classes to improve readability and maintain encapsulation.
- Follow Kotlin conventions for acronym naming:
    - Use all-uppercase for two-letter acronyms (e.g., `XP`).
    - Treat three or more letter acronyms as regular words with only the first letter capitalized (e.g., `Api`).
- Always combine title messages with chat message.
  - This way users know what feature and what mod sends the title, if they want to disable it.
  - Also we can include more informations why the title just showed up, as the title should not be too long.

### Compatibility with modern versions
As SkyHanni gets closer to supporting multiple Minecraft versions, there are a few additional coding conventions to follow. Below are some
of the main conventions to follow to ensure that code you write should work on both 1.8.9 and modern versions. Remember that the best
way to ensure you are writing the correct code is to look at existing code for similar features and then try to follow that code. Also
looking in the `at.hannibal2.skyhanni.utils.compat` package is a good idea, as this is where most of the compatibility code will be located.
- When accessing either the player or the world use `MinecraftCompat.localPlayer()` and `MinecraftCompat.localWorld()`. These methods
both have a nullable version as well: `MinecraftCompat.localPlayerOrNull()` and `MinecraftCompat.localWorldOrNull()`. This is because on
1.8.9 while the player and world can be nullable at times, Minecraft's source code does not reflect this.
- Rendering on modern versions is done completely differently than on 1.8.9. As such, on 1.8.9 we have adjusted our rendering code to more
closely resemble modern rendering code. You may notice a `DrawContext` or `WorldRenderContext` object being passed around. These both hold
a `MatrixStack` object which is used to do some `GlStateManager` calls such as pushing and popping the matrix stack, translating and scaling.
To do most of these calls instead of using `GlStateManager` directly, you should use `DrawContextUtils` instead. If you are unsure, make sure
to look at existing code to see how it is done and if you are still unsure, ask for help.
- When making GUI screens or other GUI elements, you should try to use Renderables where possible as these should already account for
most modern rendering changes. If you are making a new GUI screen, make sure to extend `SkyHanniBaseScreen` instead of `GuiScreen` to ensure
compatibility for modern versions.

## Additional Useful Development Tools

### DevAuth

[DevAuth](https://github.com/DJtheRedstoner/DevAuth) is a tool that allows logging in to a Minecraft account while
debugging in IntelliJ. This is very useful for coding live on Hypixel without the need to compile a jar.

- The library is already downloaded by Gradle.
- SkyHanni will automatically set up DevAuth.
- Start Minecraft inside IntelliJ normally.
    - Click on the link in the console and verify with a Microsoft account.
    - The verification process will reappear every few days (after the session token expires).

### Hot Swap

Hot Swap allows reloading edited code while debugging, removing the need to restart the whole game every time.

We use [dcevm](https://dcevm.github.io/) and the IntelliJ
Plugin [HotSwap Agent](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9552-hotswapagent) to quickly reload code changes.

Follow [this](https://forums.Minecraftforge.net/topic/82228-1152-3110-intellij-and-gradlew-forge-hotswap-and-dcevm-tutorial/)
tutorial.

### [Live Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7282-liveplugin)

Allows project specific plugins to run. Eg: Regex Intention

### [Live Templates Sharing](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/25007-live-templates-sharing)

Imports our custom live templates automatically. Live Templates allow for quicker code writing.

### [Minecraft Development](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8327-minecraft-development)

Helps you write minecraft specific code such as mixins and access wideners.

## Software Used in SkyHanni

### Basics

SkyHanni is a Forge mod for Minecraft 1.8.9, written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
and [Java](https://www.java.com/en/).

We use a [Gradle configuration](https://gradle.org/) to build the mod,
written in [Kotlin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html):
[build.gradle.kts](https://github.com/hannibal002/SkyHanni/blob/beta/build.gradle.kts)

This start script will automatically download all required libraries.

### NotEnoughUpdates

SkyHanni requires **[NotEnoughUpdates](https://github.com/NotEnoughUpdates/NotEnoughUpdates/)**.
We use NEU to get auction house and bazaar price data for items and to read
the [NEU Item Repo](https://github.com/NotEnoughUpdates/NotEnoughUpdates-REPO) for item internal names, display names
and recipes.

### Config

SkyHanni stores the config (settings and user data) as a json object in a single text file.
For rendering the /sh config (categories, toggles, search, etc.),
SkyHanni uses **[MoulConfig](https://github.com/NotEnoughUpdates/MoulConfig)**, the same config system as NotEnoughUpdates.

### Elite Farmers API

SkyHanni utilizes the [Elite API](https://api.elitebot.dev/) (view the [public site here](https://elitebot.dev)) for
some farming features.

This includes features relating to Farming Weight, as well as syncing jacob contests amongst players for convenience.
All data sent is anonymized and opt-in.

### Mixin

A system to inject code into the original Minecraft code.
This library is not part of SkyHanni or Forge, but we bundle it.

It allows to easily modify methods in Minecraft itself, without conflicting with other mods.

For more information, see https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin or [our existing mixins](https://github.com/hannibal002/SkyHanni/tree/beta/src/main/java/at/hannibal2/skyhanni/mixins/transformers).

When creating new Mixins, try to keep the code inside the mixin as small as possible, and calling a hook as soon as
possible.

### Repo

SkyHanni uses a repo system to easily change static variables without the need for a mod update.
The repo is located at https://github.com/hannibal002/SkyHanni-REPO.
A copy of all json files is stored on the computer under `.minecraft\config\skyhanni\repo`.
On every game start, the copy gets updated (if outdated and if not manually disabled).
If you add stuff to the repo make sure it gets serialised. See
the [JsonObjects](src/main/java/at/hannibal2/skyhanni/data/jsonobjects/repo)
folder for how to properly do this. You also may have to disable repo auto update in game.

### Discord IPC

DiscordIPC is a service that SkyHanni uses to send information from SkyBlock to Discord in Rich Presence. <br>
For info on usage, look at [DiscordRPCManager.kt](https://github.com/hannibal002/SkyHanni/blob/beta/src/main/java/at/hannibal2/skyhanni/features/misc/discordrpc/DiscordRPCManager.kt)

### Auto Updater

We use the [auto update library](https://github.com/nea89o/libautoupdate) from nea89.

### Discord Bot

While not directly part of the Minecraft mod, it is useful to know that we have
a [Discord Bot](https://github.com/SkyHanniStudios/DiscordBot) that helps with small tasks related to PRs.

## 1.21 / Modern version development

You might have noticed that while the SkyHanni source code is found in `src/`, the actual tasks for compiling, building and running the mod
are located in a subproject called `1.8.9`. This is because SkyHanni is preparing for the eventual fall of 1.8.9 (via the foraging update or
otherwise).

To do so (while not disrupting regular development) we use [preprocessor](https://github.com/Deftu/RM-Preprocessor). Preprocessor
automatically transforms code based on mappings as well as comment directives to create multiple variants of your source code for
different Minecraft versions.

Note also that the only targets we consider are 1.8.9 and 1.21 (or whatever the latest version we may target). The other versions are only there
to make mappings translate more easily (more on that later).

### Goals

It is the explicit goal of this operation to passively generate a 1.21 version of SH using preprocessor. To this end, contributors are
encouraged to add mappings and preprocessing directives to their features to make them compile on 1.21. *However*, this is considered a very
low priority. Due to the confusing nature (and the slower initial setup time due to decompiling four versions of Minecraft), this feature
is disabled by default. Similarly, it is up to each contributor to decide if they want to learn how to use preprocessor mappings and
directives. An explicit non-goal is to maintain two SH versions continuously; instead, we only want to make the eventual transition to 1.21 a task
that can be slowly worked on over a long span of time.

### Set Up

The modern version variants can be set using `skyhanni.multi-version` in `.gradle/private.properties` to three levels.
You will have to create this file yourself, for example if you want to set it to compile the file should contain `skyhanni.multi-version=compile` 

`off` completely disables any preprocessor action or alternative versions. There will be only one project (although still at the `:1.8.9`
subproject path), and alternative version sources will not be generated (although old generated sources **will not be deleted**). To make
setting up a dev environment as fast and discernible as possible, this is the default option.

`preprocess-only` adds the `preprocessCode` task as well as all the version subprojects. Compiling or running newer versions is not
possible, but the `preprocessCode` task can be run manually to inspect the generated source code. This mode is what should most often be
used when making alterations to the mappings or modifying preprocessor directives. Note that while this setting generally ignores any failed
renaming attempts, if something is so badly mangled that it cannot even guess a name for a function, it will still break the build. Those
situations should be rare, however. (In the entire SH codebase prior to me introducing this system I only found <10 such cases). You can
specifically compile 1.8.9 using `./gradlew :1.8.9:build`. This does not affect the regular execution of the client which will only compile
1.8.9.

`compile` enables compilation for the `:1.21` subproject. This means that a `build` or `assemble` task will try (and fail) to compile a
1.21 (as well as 1.8.9) JAR. This mode may be useful for someone seeking out issues to fix, but is generally not useful in day to day
operations since the compile task will never succeed and will block things like hotswap compilations (via <kbd>CTRL+F9</kbd>) from completing.

### Compiling and Testing

To compile the mod, simply run `./gradlew build` (without a version number), and the preprocessor will generate the necessary files for each
version up to 1.21. By default, only a few files will be compiled, these files can be found in the `versions/<version>/buildpaths.txt` file.
If you want to compile more files, you can add them to this file or if you want to compile all files you can temporarily remove the file.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Notice:** For this to work you **Must** have the `skyhanni.multi-version` set too `compile` in your `.gradle/private.properties` file.

If you want to run 1.21 simply run the `Minecraft Client 1.21` configuration in intellij. This will compile the 1.21 version and run it.
Again, this will only use the files specified in `versions/<version>/buildpaths.txt`.

### Improving mappings

The different project versions are set up in such a way that each version depends on a slightly older version from which it is then adapted.
There are two main versions (1.8.9 and 1.21), but there are also a few bridge versions. These exist to make remapping easier since automatic
name mappings between 1.8.9 and 1.21 do not really exist. This is the current layout for our remaps: First, we remap to 1.12. This still
largely uses the old rendering system and has a lot of similar names to 1.8.9. As such, only very little needs to be adapted in terms of
behaviour, and at best, a couple of names need to be updated manually. The big jump is from 1.12 to 1.16. We use 1.16 since we don't want to
make too large of a jump (which could lead to a lot more missing names), but we still want to jump to a version with Fabric (and specifically
with Fabric intermediary mappings). We also can't really jump to an earlier version since 1.14 and 1.15 have a really poor Fabric API and
still have some of the old rendering code, meaning we would need to adapt to two slightly different rendering engines instead of just one
big rendering change. Despite the preprocessor's best efforts, this version will likely have the most manual mapping changes. Note that we
actually have two projects on 1.16. There is the Forge project, which is the one we remap to first. Then we remap to the corresponding
Fabric/Yarn mappings. This is because remapping between Searge and Yarn is very inconsistent unless it is done on one and the same version.
Finally, we remap from 1.16 to 1.21. This is a fairly small change, especially since Fabric intermediary mappings make different names
between versions very rare. The only real changes that need to be done in this jump are behavioural ones.

The preprocessor does some built-in remapping (changing names), based on obfuscated names, but sometimes the automatic matching fails. If it
cannot find a new name (or the name it automatically determines was wrong), you can change the corresponding mapping. In order to make
this as smooth as possible, it is generally recommended to find the earliest spot at which the mappings deviate. So fixing a mapping on the
hop from 1.16 to 1.21 is generally not recommended. This is because, while we do not care about 1.12 or 1.16 compiling for its own merit,
we do care about the automatically inferred name changes from 1.12 to 1.16 and so on, which only work if those versions already have the
correct names available.

#### A missing/incorrect name

This is the easiest part. If a name for a function simply could not be automatically remapped, all you need to do is to add an entry in the
corresponding mapping.txt file. These can be found at `versions/mapping-<newVersion>-<oldVersion>.txt`.

```
# You can use # to comment lines

# You can rename a class simply by writing the two names
# The first name is the name on the newer version (the first one in the file name); the second one is the name in the old version.
net.minecraft.util.math.MathHelper net.minecraft.util.MathHelper
# If you want to rename an inner class, remember to use $s
net.minecraft.world.scores.Team$Visibility net.minecraft.scoreboard.Team$EnumVisible

# You can rename a field by writing the name of the containing class in the new version, and then the new and old name of the field.
# Again, the first field name is the one in the newer version (first in the file name).
net.minecraft.world.entity.Entity xOld prevPosX

# Finally, you can also rename methods. To do so, you need to first specify the name of the containing class in the new version, then
# the name of the new and old method name. The first method name is the newer version name (first in the file name).
net.minecraft.util.text.Style getHoverEvent() getChatHoverEvent()
```

Adding a mapping like this is the easiest way to fix a broken method call, field access, or class reference. It will also apply to all
files, so you might be fixing issues in files you didn't even look at. It will even work in mixin targets, as long as they are unambiguous
(consider using the method descriptor instead of just the method name for your mixin). However, if something aside from the name changed,
this will not suffice.

After adding new mappings to the mappings file don't forget to run `./gradlew cleanupMappingFiles` to automatically sort the mappings file.

#### Custom mappings

If you need to do a bit more advanced remapping that requires an import to be added to the file, you can add a custom mapping. This is
done by creating/editing a pattern mappings file which can be found at `versions/pattern-mapping-<newVersion>-<oldVersion>.txt`.

```
# You can use # to comment lines

# here is the format of these files
# newClass oldClass newMethod oldMethod neededImport

# heres an example mapping
net.minecraft.world.entity.Entity net.minecraft.entity.Entity name.getFormattedTextCompat() getName() at.hannibal2.skyhanni.utils.compat.getFormattedTextCompat
```

This will change all calls of Entity.name to be Entity.name.getFormattedTextCompat(). The import will also be added to the file. This is
helpful for places where the return type may have changed across minecraft versions, and then you need to call a compat method to get the
same result as on previous versions.

#### Conditional compilation

In addition to the built-in remapping, there is also the more complicated art of preprocessor directives. Directives allow you to comment or
uncomment sections of the code depending on the version you are on. Uncommented sections are renamed as usual, so even within those directives,
you only need to write code for the *lowest* version that your comment is active in. As such, I once again highly recommend to target your
directive to the lowest version in which it applies, so that other sections that call into that code as well as your code can make use of
as many automatic renames as possible.

There is only really one directive, which is `if`. Take this function, for example:

```kt
private fun WorldClient.getAllEntities(): Iterable<Entity> =
//#if MC < 1.16
    loadedEntityList
//#else
//$$    entitiesForRendering()
//#endif
```

The first `#if` instructs the preprocessor to only uncomment the following code if the Minecraft version is less than 1.16. Then, the `#else`
uncomments the other section on versions 1.16 and above. Finally, the `#endif` ends the else block and lets the following functions always remain
active. To distinguish regular comments from preprocessor comments, preprocessor only works with comments that start with `//$$`. So let's
walk through what is happening here.

In 1.8.9, the code remains unchanged. **Note that this means the programmer is responsible for commenting out the unused parts.
The preprocessor will never change the `src/` directory**.

Next, the preprocessor converts the code to 1.12. 1.12 still has the `loadedEntityList` as well as the same name for the `WorldClient` and
`Entity` classes, so nothing is changed.

Next, the code gets converted to 1.16 Forge. Since 1.16 is not less than 1.16, it will comment out the first line and uncomment the second line.
1.16 Forge also uses a different name for `WorldClient` and a different package for `Entity`, so those are also changed (the package change
is only visible in the imports):

```kt
private fun ClientLevel.getAllEntities(): Iterable<Entity> =
//#if MC < 1.14
//$$         loadedEntityList
//#else
    entitiesForRendering()
//#endif
```

Now the code gets converted to 1.16 Fabric. Since those two targets are on the same Minecraft version name changes almost never fail to be
done automatically. Notice the different names for `ClientWorld` as well as `entities`. The method is called `getEntities()` on Fabric, but
since this is Kotlin code, the preprocessor automatically cleans up `getEntities()` using
[Kotlin property access syntax](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/java-interop.html#getters-and-setters).

```kt
private fun ClientWorld.getAllEntities(): Iterable<Entity> =
//#if MC < 1.14
//$$         loadedEntityList
//#else
    entities
//#endif
```

Finally, the code gets converted to 1.21 using intermediary mappings. This last step does not bring any new challenges, so we end up with:

```kt
private fun ClientWorld.getAllEntities(): Iterable<Entity> =
//#if MC < 1.14
//$$         loadedEntityList
//#else
    entities
//#endif
```

#### If expressions

Let's look at the syntax of those `#if` expressions.

First of all, the `#else` block is optional. If you just want code on some versions (for example for adding a method call that is implicitly
done on newer versions, or simply because the corresponding code for newer versions has to be done in some other place), you can just omit
the `#else` section, and you will simply not compile any code at that spot.

There is also an `#elseif` in case you want to switch behaviour based on multiple version brackets. Again, while we don't actually target
1.12 or 1.16, making those versions compile will help other parts of the code to upgrade to 1.21 more cleanly and easily. So, making those
versions work (or at least providing a stub like `error("Not implemented on this version") as List<Entity>` to make types infer correctly)
should be something you look out for.

`#if` and `#elseif` also do not support complicated expressions. The only operations supported are `!=`, `==`, `>=`, `<=`, `<` and `>`. You
cannot join two checks using `&&` or similar, instead needing to use nested `#if`s.

The actual versions being worked with here are not actually semantically compared Minecraft versions, but instead integers in the form
`major * 10000 + minor * 100 + patch`. So, for example, `1.12` turns into `11200`. Both `11200` and `1.12` can be used in directives, but
`1.12` style values are generally easier to understand.

You can also check if you are on Forge using the `FORGE` variable. It is set to either 1 or 0. Similarly, there is also a `JAVA` variable to
check the Java version this Minecraft version is on. For the `FORGE` variable there is an implicit `!= 0` to check added if you just check
for the variable using `#if FORGE`.

#### Helpers

Sadly, `#if` expressions cannot be applied globally (unlike name changes), so it is often very helpful to create a helper method and call
that method from various places in the codebase. This is generally already policy in SH for a lot of things. For more complex types that
change beyond just their name (for example different generics), a `typealias` can be used in combination with `#if` expressions.

These helper methods should generally be placed in the `at.hannibal2.skyhanni.utils.compat` package and should be named after what they are
compatability methods for. For example, `WorldClient.getAllEntities()` could be placed in `WorldCompat.kt`. This is not a strict rule, but
it is a good guideline to follow as for the most part we do not want to be doing large amount of preprocessing in the feature files
themselves.


### Access Wideners

You may want to use private minecraft methods or fields, this is where access wideners come in. 
Access wideners are a way to access private methods and fields in Minecraft classes. They are used to modify the access level of a method or 
field and allow it to be accessed from other classes. This is an easier alternative to using mixins and making an accessor.
To get an access widener entry, you can use the Minecraft Development plugin for IntelliJ. Then you can right-click on a method or field and 
select `Copy / Paste Special` -> `AW Entry` and paste this into the bottom of `versions/<version number>/src/main/resources/skyhanni.accesswidener`.
Then you need to reload gradle for the changes to apply.

This requires you to have the Minecraft Development plugin installed as mentioned earlier.
